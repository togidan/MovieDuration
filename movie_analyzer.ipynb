    "# Movie Times Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You ever watch a movie and just think, \"Wow this could've been a much shorter film to get the story across..\"? Yeah, me too. So for this analysis, I want to figure out what happeend and maybe I'm suffering from a fake sense of nostalgia for movies not being nearly as long. Of course there are things like when I was a child I perceived time different ##INSERT LINK HERE## or that kids movies in particular are just not very long to begin with.\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to try and figure out what variables might help predict the length of a movie. Some questions to answer are:\n",
    "* Are average movie lengths getting longer over time?\n",
    "* Are certain genre's increasing in length over time?\n",
    "* Is there a way to highlight blockbusters and see if they alone are getting longer?\n",
    "* Is there a correlation between box office success and the length of the movie?\n",
    "* Ultimately, what are some reasons movies are starting to get longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be using the [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) as my source for movie information. This is essentially a Wikipedia for movies that includes inforamtion such as release date, genre, audience scores, etc...\n",
